      <description>In this article I will explain the mechanics of writing a client for Google GCP, pretty similar like gcloud. The purpose is to not write a full-featured client (that would make no sense, since you can use gcloud already) but to learn the how to communicate with Google&amp;rsquo;s GCP API using Go. Such a pkg can be useful in small projects where you need to talk to Google GCP API, like the OpenShift&amp;rsquo;s GCP Operator.</description>

      <description>Write your own controller Before going down the operator framework out there, it is important to understand what is happening under the hood. Then you would be able to appreciate the generated boilerplate code and feel more comfortable to change it.
Prereq This tutorial assumes you have a cluster up and running and you can successfully communicate with it (e.g. kubectl get pods -A should work). If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a cluster, you can setup one locally using CodeReadyContainers(used by the tutorial) or minikube.</description>
