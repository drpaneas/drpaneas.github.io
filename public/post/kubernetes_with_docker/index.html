        <h2 id="what-is-kubernetes">What is Kubernetes<a href="#what-is-kubernetes" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>By definition, Kubernetes is an open source container cluster manager, and it is
usually referred to by its internal name withing Google development - <strong>k8s</strong>.
Google donated it to the open source world as a <em>&ldquo;seed technology&rdquo;</em> at 2015, to
the newly formed <em>CNCF - Cloud Native Computing Foundation</em>, which established
partnership with <em>The Linux Foundation</em>. The primary goal of Kubernetes is to
provide a platform for automating deployment, scaling and operations of
application containers across a cluster of hosts. In fact, withing Google they
have been using Kubernetes-like tools in order to run daily billions of
containers within their services.</p>
<h3 id="design-overview">Design Overview<a href="#design-overview" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Kubernetes is built through a set of components (building blocks or
<em>primitives</em>), which when they are used collectively, then they provide a
method for the deployment, maintenance and scalability or container based
application clusters. These <em>primitives</em> are designed to operate without
requiring any kind of special knowledge from the user. They are really easy to
work with and they are also highly extensible through an API. All the
components of Kubernetes (internal, extensions and containers) are making use
of the API.</p>
<p>Although Kubernetes was originally designed withing Google&rsquo;s infrastructure,
nowadays it&rsquo;s considered the default option for other majer public cloud
providers, such as AWS and Azure.</p>
<h3 id="components">Components<a href="#components" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>So, what are the components (building blocks) that are going into to
Kubernetes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nodes (often referred to as minions)</li>
<li>Pods</li>
<li>Labels</li>
<li>Selectors</li>
<li>Controllers (multiple kinds of them)</li>
<li>Services</li>
<li>Control Pane (the master controller)</li>
<li>API</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these topics are relatively involved, so you need to practice by
yourself and manage your own Kubernetes environment, in order to be able to
understand at &lsquo;experience&rsquo; level, how these things work.</p>
<h3 id="architecture">Architecture<a href="#architecture" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>In a very-very high-level view, we have these kubernetes building-blocks we
talked about. This is really how the whole environment looks like:</p>
<p><img src="/images/kubernetes_architecture.png" alt="Kubernetes Architecture"></p>
<p>We have <em>one</em> <strong>master/controller</strong>  and we have <em>1-to-N</em> <strong>nodes</strong> which can
have <em>1-to-N</em> <strong>pods</strong> and each pod can have <em>1-to-N</em> <strong>containers</strong>. How many
of those <em>N</em> things you need, it is based upon the desired state of the
configuration which is located in the <em>master/controller</em> via <em>YAML</em> form.
Also, this depends on the minion resources (either physical or virtual) that
you can allocate.</p>
<p>Each node has to have at least some container management engine installed, such
as Docker.</p>
<h4 id="nodes-minions">Nodes (Minions)<a href="#nodes-minions" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>You can think of these as <em>container clients</em> and they can be either physical
or virtual. Also, your container management engine has to be installed on, (such
as Docker) and hosts the various containers within your managed cluster.</p>
<p>Furthermore, each minion will run <strong>ETCD</strong>, as well as the <em>master/controller</em>.
ETCD is a key-pair management and communication service, used by Kubernetes
for exchanging messages and reporting on cluster status. It&rsquo;s a way for us to
keep everything in-sync and exchange information from the individual minions to
our master controller and as well as our Kubernetes Proxy &ndash; that&rsquo;s the other
item that runs on each of the minions. So, for each minion there are two things
that are running and are specific to Kubernetes, which is ETCD and Kubernetes
Proxy, and last but not least, Docker has to be installed as well. During this
tutorial we will go over all these packages and install them.</p>
<h4 id="pods">Pods<a href="#pods" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>The simplest definition is that a pod consists of one or more containers. Going
further, these containers are then guaranteed (by the master controller) to be
located on the same host machine in order to facilitate shared resources
(volumes, services mapped through ports). Pods are assigned with unique IPs
within each cluster, so these allow our application to use ports for the Pod
without having to worry about conflicting port utilization. In another words, I
can have multiple Pods running at port <code>80</code> or <code>443</code> or <code>whatever</code>, on the same
host, because I am not re-mapping those ports but I am giving each Pod a unique
IP address within the cluster, so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about port conflicts.</p>
<p>Pods can contain definitions of disk volumes or share, and then provide
access from those to all the containers within the pod.</p>
<p>An the finally, pod management is done through the API or delegated to a
controller.</p>
<h4 id="labels">Labels<a href="#labels" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>Clients can attach &ldquo;key-value pairs&rdquo; to any object in the system (like Pods or
Nodes). These become the labels that identify them in the configuration and
management of them. And this is where <em>Selectors</em> come in, because they are
used in conjuction.</p>
<h4 id="selectors">Selectors<a href="#selectors" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>Label Selectors represent queries that are made against those labels. They
resolve to the corresponding matching objects and will show when we are
managing our Pods in our cluster how we use the built-in API and tools for
Kubernetes in order to get a selection of objects based on these label
selectors.</p>
<p>These two items (Labels and Selectors) are the primary way that grouping is
done in Kubernetes and determine which components that a given operation
applies to when indicated.</p>
<h4 id="controllers">Controllers<a href="#controllers" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>These are used in the management of your cluster. Controllers are the mechanism
by which your desired configuration state is enforced. In fact the controllers
main purpose is to enforce the desired state of your configuration to your
cluster. They manage a set of pods and, depending on the desired configuration
state, may engage other controllers to handle replication and scaling (through the
<strong>Replication Controller</strong>) of XX number of containers and pods across the cluster.
It is also responsible for replacing any container in a pod that fails or any
container in the cluster that fails (based on the desired state of the cluster).
And again, all these are representing a desired state written in YAML files.</p>
<p>Other controllers that can be engaged include <strong>DaemonSet Controller</strong> which
enforces a 1:1 ration of pods to minions and a <strong>Job Controller</strong> that runs
pods to &ldquo;completion&rdquo;, such as in batch jobs. Each set of pods any controller
manages, is determined by the label selectors that are part of its definition.</p>
<h2 id="setup-and-configuration">Setup and Configuration<a href="#setup-and-configuration" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<h3 id="packages-and-dependencies">Packages and Dependencies<a href="#packages-and-dependencies" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>One of the first things we need to do is to install NTP. NTP has to be
enabled and running in <strong>all</strong> of the servers we are going to have in
our cluster. In this example, I have four terminals open:</p>
<pre><code>- centos-master		[172.31.28.38] 		[54.154.199.96]
- centos-minion1	[172.31.120.121]	[54.171.6.143]
- centos-minion2	[54.246.160.157]	[172.31.110.96]
- centos-minion3	[54.246.220.156]	[172.31.23.169]
</code></pre><p>So we are going to use 3 minions as worker nodes, and then 1 server as the
master in our cluster. So, lets us install ntp:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">yum install -y ntp
</code></pre></div><p>We want to be sure that all the servers in our cluster are time-synchronised
down to the second. This is because we are going to use a service that logs
what happen to our cluster upon special conditions and it is important that
our servers are reporting as close and as accurate as possible.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">systemctl enable ntpd
systemctl start ntpd
</code></pre></div><p>Feel free to check the status in order to verify that is running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">systemctl status ntpd
</code></pre></div><p>As soon as we finish with the installation of <code>ntp</code> in all of our servers in
the cluster, then we need to make sure that we have full name resolution for
the servers in our environment. If you are installing this locally and you
do not port-forward this ports externally, then it is best to use your internal
IP addresses rather than the external ones. Similarly, this means that you cannot
use the name of the server, because this will refer to the external IP address.
But, to make things look as they supposed to be, I am going to create a file
<code>/etc/hosts</code> with the corrersponding nickname of these servers. This file has to
be into each server that is part of my cluster and it has to resolve the nicknames
against the internal/private IP address. In that case, I will be able to use those
internal hostnames in my configuration file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">vim /etc/hosts

172.31.28.38    centos-master
172.31.120.121  centos-minion1
172.31.110.96   centos-minion2
172.31.23.169   centos-minion3
</code></pre></div><p>Put this into every server and then make sure that all of them can ping each other
based on those nicknames:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ping centos-master
ping centos-minion1
ping centos-minion2
ping centos-minion3
</code></pre></div><p>As soon as you finished this and your verified that all server can ping each other
based on their internal IP address, it is about time to add a repository that we
can use to install the latest version of <code>Docker</code> and <code>Kubernetes</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">vim /etc/yum.repos.d/virt7-docker-common-release.repo
<span style="color:#f92672">[</span>virt7-docker-common-release<span style="color:#f92672">]</span>

gpgcheck<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Save it and then update the cache of the system:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">yum update
</code></pre></div><p>Make sure you do this for all the server in the cluster.</p>
<p>Next, make sure that all firewalls are disabled, since this is a demo and not
a production environment, so we need to avoid problems of port filtering.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">systemctl status iptables  --&gt; disabled
systemctl status firewalld --&gt; disabled
</code></pre></div><p>Ok, now it is about time to install <code>etcd</code>. This is the mechanism that helps
all the members of the cluster to communicate and advertise their status,
availability, and their logs. So, we need to install <code>etcd</code> and <code>kubernetes</code>.
These two, will also pull <code>cadvisor</code> which for containers and containerized
apps. Then we will, start configuring the master and the minion, but right
now I will finish by installing the software:</p>
<pre><code>yum install -y --enablerepo=virt7-docker-common-release kubernetes docker
</code></pre><h3 id="configure-the-master">Configure the Master<a href="#configure-the-master" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Since we are into the master, we first need to configure the Kubernetes
itself:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>As soon as we verify that all of the are working as expedted, now we have
to verify also that docker works. To do, I am going to use a simple
containerized app, called <code>hello world</code> &ndash; what a surprise.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">docker pull hello-world

</code></pre></div><p>Now we have our minion configuration complete and actually it has to
be registered against our master. Please make sure that the same config
exists in the rest 2 minions, before you proceed.</p>
<h3 id="interact-with-the-cluster">Interact with the cluster<a href="#interact-with-the-cluster" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>The main utility for interacting with the kubernetes cluster, is called
<code>kubectl</code> &ndash; kubecontrol.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">man kubectl
</code></pre></div><p>Usually, either you <strong>get</strong> sth or <strong>set</strong> something. For example,
if you want to see the nodes which are registerested againsto our
master:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">kubectl get nodes
</code></pre></div><p>But, how do I know what are the potential parameteres for that command?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">man kubectl-get
</code></pre></div><p>For example, I can get some information about those nodes:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">kubectl describe nodes

<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;pattern&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In the future, we will do <code>kubectl get pods</code>. A minion is a node
that is registered in our cluster in which we can install pods on.
Pods contain containers of things, such as services (apache, ngix, etc).</p>
<h2 id="run-containers-in-pods">Run Containers in Pods<a href="#run-containers-in-pods" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>So, after having our environment set and all of our nodes are registered
against the master node, it is about time to run containers inside of
Pod in our cluster. For now, we are going to go through the initial
configuration of setting up Pods in our 3 minions. For the shake of
less complexity, I am going to turn-off the 2 out of the 3 minions,
so I am going to to deploy Pods into a single node.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#f92672">[</span>root@drpaneas1 ~<span style="color:#f92672">]</span><span style="color:#75715e"># kubectl get nodes</span>

centos-minion3   NotReady   19h
</code></pre></div><p>As I said, 3 minions are registered, but only one of them is ready
to use.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-pod">Create a Pod<a href="#create-a-pod" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>First of all, we need to create a Build directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mkdir Builds
cd Builds
</code></pre></div><p>Now there are two ways that we can begin to generate Pods which will
contain Docker containers in our environment.</p>
<ol>
<li>We can create configuration file using JSON</li>
<li>We can create configuration file using YAML</li>
</ol>
<p>From the configuration point of view, I am going to focus only to YAML.
From a definition stand point, YAML is better for configuration and
JSON is preffered as output. But, for input and configuration, I like
to use YAML because I think it is simpler to use.</p>
<p>So, to create a Pod, we need to create a <em>definition</em>. So, <em>keep in mind</em>
that a Pod Definition is like telling Kubernetes the <em>desired state of
our Pod</em>. It is really important to understand that the desired state
is a key concept, because it is the key reponsibility of Kubernetes to
ensure that the current state of the cluster matches the defined as
desired state. So, if any of the things in desired state is not functioning
then it us up to Kubernetes to relocate them or recreated them in order
to drive our cluster to the desired state until the administrator says
otherwise (e.g. delete the Pod). So, I am going to create a very simple
configuration for out first Pod, a <code>nginx</code> yaml configuration and also
follow the examples from kubernetes documentation. Make sure you are
into the <code>Builds</code> directory and create our first Pod definition:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">vim nginx.yaml
</code></pre></div><p>I will create a Pod that has just one single container in it. The Pod will
be named after <code>nginx</code> and so does the container also. In the container, I
would like to run <code>nginx version 1.7.9</code> and port forward (expose) <code>TCP 80</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="color:#f92672">apiVersion</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">v1</span>

    <span style="color:#f92672">ports</span>:
    - <span style="color:#f92672">containerPort</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">80</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now, if you remember, using <code>kubectl</code> we can see what <code>pods</code> we have. So, right
now we should not have any pods created yet. Also, if I go to our minion and
look for currently active containers <code>docker ps</code> there will be none. So, the
current state is that I have no <code>pods</code>, no <code>services</code>, no <code>replication controllers</code>.
So, now, I am going to launch a Pod within my cluster, and Kubernetes is going
to determine based on the current available worker nodes (minions) where to launch
the container. It is very easy to do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">kubectl create -f ./nginx.yaml
pod <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;nginx&#34;</span> created
</code></pre></div><p>So, if I check for Pod now in my cluster:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#75715e"># kubectl get pods</span>

</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, my Pod called <code>nginx</code> is already running. Let us go to the minion
and verify that the container <code>nginx</code> is also running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#f92672">[</span>root@drpaneas2 ~<span style="color:#f92672">]</span><span style="color:#75715e"># docker ps</span>

I can do, is to run other containers within my Pod and as long as they
are in the same host they can see those containers which are defined
within that Pod. So, I am going to run another container: <code>busybox</code> image.
This is very minimal installation of Linux running Busybox, that will
allows us to connect/test our <code>nginx</code> container.</p>
<p>Instead of creating a proper YAML file, this is just a shortcut, mostly
because this is just for test reasons. So this is going to create a Pod
called <code>busybox</code> and create also inside of it a docker container with
the docker image <code>--image=busybox</code> and it will be also be
an ephemeral <code>--restart=Never</code>. As soon as it will be ready it will be
spawn interactivly here <code>--tty -i</code> and it runs in api version 1.</p>

I can also `cheat` in a way in order to get access to the services that might be
running on one of my containers. This is by port-forwarding locally to a remote
copy of what happens to be happen within our Pod. So, because we already removed
the `nginx` pod. I am going to create one again:

```bash

</code></pre></div><p>So now we have a Pod Definition created but one of the things we do not have
is an easy way to talk about what that Pod is all about and what it might
contain. So, I am goin to apply labels and selectors.</p>
<h3 id="labels-and-selectors">Labels and Selectors<a href="#labels-and-selectors" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Labels are often reffered to as <code>tags</code> in order to differentiate more easily
the Pods running in our system. Because you might run some thousands of Pods
in your system, so it makes sense to apply some common naming scheme to know
how you can sort the information that is available. All that a label does
is to give us a easy-readable plain text to something we can refer to later.
It is a key value that we can also define in our YAML file, and we can also
use it later to get or set information.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>This is an easy way to refer to complex infrastucture that I am  virtualizing as
a container in my cluster. So these tags or labels are what is called selectors
when we are getting information or when we apply information to a pod. This is because
we can selectively apply things like deployments to a specific Pod in my environment.
That is all what labels are for, to differentiate key-value pairs in YAML that later
I can identify various parts. We can assign any label we want that we can refer to later.</p>
<h3 id="deployment">Deployment<a href="#deployment" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>One of the advantages of labelling is that we can use deployment type. Before, we just
launched a Pod, but now we are going to launch a Deployment. The reason we are going to
differenciate launching a Pod from a Deployment is because it gives us felxibility
and easier management over our cluter. This means that we are going to deploy a Pod
that is goint to be a <em>production</em> <code>nginx server</code> container, and then we are going to
deploy one that is going to be the development. Then we are going to label them
appropriately so we can update one, and not the other. So let us copy the current
configuration and modify it later on:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">cp nginx-pod-label.yaml nginx-deployment-prod.yaml
</code></pre></div><p>Well, obviously the <code>kind</code> is going to change from <code>Pod</code> into <code>Deployment</code>, but before
we do that, we have to change the <code>API</code> version. This is because we are not going to
use the standard API but some of the extensions which is available for Kubernetes.
This extension gives us the ability to create a kind of deployment, as right now is
only available to beta. Then, we are going to change the name into <code>nginx-deployment-prod</code>
and also the same for the <code>app</code>. In addition, we are going to introduce a new key-value
per, called <code>replicas</code> because deployments usually deploy multiple Pods in the same time.
However, currently we just need only 1. The next thing we are going to add is a <code>template</code>.
In this way, I am going to create <code>metadata</code> that are going to be specific to this item
(template). All the others are intendted into the template. In that way we converted a
Pod definition into a production deployment.</p>

This is because it ends with the ID of the deployment:</p>

called <code>nginx-deployment-prod-872137609-z8n9m</code>, which runs an <code>nginx</code>
container. Looks like we made things even more complicated &hellip; Indeed.
This is because nobody uses a deployment structure for just one nod
with just one worker, with just one container. So, let us create another
deployment so to see the benefit of it:</p>

<code>Replicas</code> say <code>1 updates</code> which means that it got succeded. Of course if
we had mutliple replicas running, they will be updated as well. So, with one
command I would be able to update the whole container infrastructure even
though running in multiple places.</p>
<h3 id="replication-controller">Replication Controller<a href="#replication-controller" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>So far, we have been using only one Pod, but it is about time to use
multiple pod (containers). There are two ways to run a Pod, either via
a deployment or directly by referring to the Pod. The first way allows
us to have multiple containers doing different things, for example
you have a layered application running within a Pod, so you have a
webserver and a fileserver and also a database server, and I use
server in terms of individual containers. All those three run in a Pod,
and this Pod might be called a webserver environment. Howerver, the
second thing that you can do is t haty ou  can run multiple containers
within a Pod, or at least you can defined multiuple containers within
a single definition. They way we do that, is something called the
replication controller. This is a different type of <code>kind</code> of the deployment
kind in order to deploy 1-N pods for a particular container.</p>
<p>First of all, let us start the other two minions. Just make sure that the
VMs are online and <code>kubelet</code>, <code>kube-proxy</code> services are running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">systemctl start kubelet kube-proxy

</code></pre></div><p>As I said earlier, we are going to use a different kind of kind, called
<code>ReplicationController</code>. Then we define the name of this one as <code>nginx-www</code>
and then we are writing the specifications. Over there, the first thing we do
is to specify the <code>replicas</code>. In this case I am going to use <em>3</em> Pods per
selector. Speaking of selector, we specify it as <code>app: nginx</code>. Next, we
define our template. Nothing new here. In the end, the file looks like this:</p>

<p>We learned how to create, pods, deployments, replication controller, so far we can
deploy one or more containers in a node replicated in our multi-node cluster. So
lets us go ahead and re-run our configuration for our replication controller:</p>
<p>Our <code>nginx-multi-label.yaml</code> deploys 3 replicas of an <code>nginx</code> container accross
all 3 of our minions. Actually it does not neccessarrilly deploys that in all
of our minions; if our minions are doing other things, it would round-robin
those connections: if we had 4 minions, it would use 3, if we had 10 it would use
3, etc. In this case, we have 3 minions completely empty, so it makes sense for
Kubernetes to run one Pod on them:</p>

definition starts to tighted together. The services are not exposed outside
of their host. However, when we define a service, we actually referring to
a resource that can exist in any of our minions. It shoulds a little bit confusing.
All I am doing is abstracting what is running behind the scenes, providing a mechanism
for Kubernetes to simply assign a single IP address to those multiple Pods that we
reffered to by name or label (in our <code>selector</code> field in YAML) so that we can
connect to them and do something. They are going to have unique IP address and the
subsquent assign port, so any of the hosts can use these and work with the entire cluster
instead of just into their own local host.</p>

and then in the specification we are port forwarding the TCP 80 of nginx into our cluster
port 8000 (I have to manually verify that nothing is running there). Then the application

</code></pre></div><p>As you can see the <code>nginx-service</code> is running in my Cluster with the IP
10.254.78.47 and it uses the port 8000 TCP. It says <code>&lt;unset&gt;</code> because
I have not associated this port with something in my system. If I were
using the port 80, then it would not say <code>unsert</code> by <code>http</code> instead.
Notice that the <code>endpoints</code> for each minion, all of them have the
very same IP Address. This would normally be a problem, but: Kubernetes
is managing my configuration and its know manageing my connectvity on the
backend through this cluster IP, now I have the ability to get information
from any one of these, depending on which one is next up in the chain &ndash;
it does not make any difference. So this is an easy way to load-balance
your environment. You can use other load-balancers to do others things
but what we are currently doing is round-robin load-balancing between
these end-points on port 8000 for this particular IP.</p>
<p>So how do I connect do? All this go back to <code>busybox</code> we did in the
beginning.</p>

particular cluster IP is point to a cluster of minions that we have
configured to reffered to the backend Pods and their containers on Port 80

running the backend, our service is associated with only one cluster IP address
and I do not have to know anything about the backend. Not the containers, not
their ports, nothing. So, as long as I have the cluster IP which I have to
later register it via our DNS &ndash; because this ClusterIP will be persistent
only until it stopped. Once I stopped this, then my Cluster IP is going to go

<h2 id="scalability-of-the-cluster">Scalability of the cluster<a href="#scalability-of-the-cluster" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>We have control over the initial scalability of our cluster when we create Pods
inside of either deployments, Pod definitions, Replica sets or ReplicationControllers.
But what happens if the initial configuration that we have set inside of our definition
needs to be adjusted for one reason or another, or we want to add scalling to a deployment
that has not had one in the past. We can use something that is called the
<code>autoscale</code> directive in order to add and autoscale our definition. We can define
a minimum state (the minimum number of Pods) that should be running in any particular
time, as well as the maximum state (the maximum number of pods) andthen we can also
target various CPU utilization thresholds in order to deploy additional services.
In other words, once we get to 80% CPU utilization on a minion that it has pods on it,
then it will create the next set of Pods on a different minion for example.</p>
<p>We could create a set of Pods based on a ReplicationController set that already has defined
a number of replicas in it. For example, in the <code>nginx-multi-label.yaml</code> we have indicated
that we want 3 replicas of this particular pod running in our infrastructure. Right now
we have got two minions available to us (I have taken the 3rd minion offline), so let
us create a temporary pod using the <code>kubectl run</code> command. We are going to create a basic
pod that is going to have a single container in it that is going to run an <code>nginx</code> image.
We are also going to expose port 80, so our containers will be able to connect to the
service running there. Last but not least, I am not going to indicate a number of replicas
on purpose.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Now, I may need to autoscale this depending upon various conditions. The one that I have
complete control is the amount of CPU that is utilized in within my cluster. For this
I am going to use the <code>autoscale</code> directive. First I need to know the name of the deployment
(in my case <code>myautoscale</code>) and then I need to spacify at least on parameter. I am going to
say I need to deploy at least 2 pods (because I know already I have 2 minions to utilize)
and I am going to also say that I would like to have a maximum deployment of 6 pods.
And last but not least, my CPU percent is goingto be equal to some number (<code>--cpu-precent</code>)
but since the cpu load on my minions is really low, I know that  I am not going to utlize
this, so I am going to skip this and use the default scaling police. The default policy says
that when the number of pods exceeds the number of resources on the minion (or it stops
responding) then it will spin up new pods in on other minions. So, it should automatically
scale up to at least 2 pods.</p>

that means that I do not have the ability to scale further my current environment

to what you can scale down to. You cannot scale pass the point when you
applied the autoscale to <code>--min</code> value. In other words, I cannot apply a
scale rule that has a lower value than 2. Because when I originally applied
the autoscale, I said that I wantto have 2 minimum pods. So, even if I now say
that I want to scale down to 1, it will still deploy 2. But, I can scale down
to 3.</p>

the shortest amount of time. Many people thing that Kubernetes terminates the latest
instance, but this is not true. If you for example restart you first instance
the running time of it is going to go back to zero, so, this is goingto be
terminated first in a scenario like that (scale down).</p>
<p>So what is is important to keep in mind is that as long as I have a deployment
or a replicaset or a replication controller definition, no matter if I am
doing this automatically or via a YAML file, I can autoscale that by applying
an autoscale defintion into it, and then I can further scale it by using
scale. But I cannot go lower than my original minimum limit.</p>
<p>If now I fire up my 3rd minion, then Kubernetes will understand that my environment
has now the capacity to run more minions:</p>
<h2 id="failure-and-recovery">Failure and Recovery<a href="#failure-and-recovery" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p><strong>Before version 1.5</strong></p>
<p>Kubernetes has the ability to detect when something has failed and the ability
to recover when this failure has been corrected an then to react to that failure
by taking action. One of the things to keep in mind, is that parts of the
underlying functionality is that one a Pod has been deployed to a minion, it is
guaranteed to be on that particular minion for its entire lifecycle. That means
until the Pod is deleted, you will always have that Pod there. That means, in
case of a failure, the Pod is just going to go down, but not picked up and moved
somewhere else. The reason is double:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There might be IP Addresses and back-end services which that Pod is tight to
that particular minion (e.g. volume mounts) &ndash; such stuff are not portable
between minions; because it cannot depend upon minion configuration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other pods that exists on that host, espect to have access to those recourses
but if it moves somewhere else, then other Pods on that minion, if it was a
service failure and you just re-deployed the Pod to a different minion in order
to recover, would not neccessarrily have access to that resources.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But the recovery works OK, because the Pod will be re-deployed in its entirety
and its exact configuration once the minion is available. So let us go ahead
and deploy a deployment which has at least 2 Pod on each of the two minions
we have in our configuration right now.</p>

in my master controller and cannot report to it. Back to the master
controller, it is going to take up to <em>minute</em> to its <code>etcd</code> to pick
up the fact that <em>minion_1</em> is no longer available. So, for some time
frame kubectl will print wrong information about running Pods and
connected nodes. But as I said, after some time, it picks up the failure:</p>

that whatever was running minion1, it will be moved to minion2. But it does not.
And this is for the reason I told you before. Because this pod might have containers
which utilize dependencies on the underlying minion host and/or may have other pods
that need access to those services. In that case the pod would have attempted to be
restarted because I have applied replicas to it, but that <strong>only</strong> applies when a
failed replica gets restarted on its original minion. So, in this case, if the
original host is not available, you never gonna see the pod to move to minion1
in order to match the desired state of replica 2.</p>
<p>As soon as you start the services in minion1, Kubernetes will detect this
and respawn the Pod in minion1.</p>
<p><strong>After Kuberentes 1.5</strong></p>
<p>With the introduction of version 1.5, there is a notable change in this behavior.
Kubernetes quickly detects that a node is down, and it marks that Pod as in unknown
state for some minutes. If the minion is not getting up, then Kuberentes moves this pod
into another minion.</p>

(in that case <code>qfc71</code>) completely and keeps maintaining the new pod
(with new ID <code>b7fvz</code>) on minion2. So, you end up with 4 containers
running in the same host.</p>
