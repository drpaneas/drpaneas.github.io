## Setup

Some fun facts about [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/):

* Built in [Go](https://golang.org/)
* Loosely inspired by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* Primarily developed by [spf13](https://spf13.com/) on the train while commuting to and from Manhattan.
* Coded in [Vim](https://vim.org) using [spf13-vim](https://vim.spf13.com/)

This is a code text

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
paok=win
echo "$paok hehe"
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.

Thanks for reading!
