<p>How secure is our daily interaction with security ?</p>

<p>What is Human-Computer Iteraction</p>

<p>Human-Computer Interaction, which is commonly abbreviated as HCI, is the study
of how people interact with technology. Those people can be your average user,
either working with desktop, laptops, smartphones or sensors (<em>e.g.</em>
stepcounter) to measure how they interact with the world. In HCI we want to
understand:</p>

<ol>
<li>the people</li>
<li>the technology</li>
<li>their interaction</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-people:d554dde27ecc4b58f50be1ae68f8125f">The people:</h2>

<p>From the people perspective, we want to understand both psychological and
cognitive abilities of the user.</p>

<h2 id="the-technology:d554dde27ecc4b58f50be1ae68f8125f">The technology:</h2>

<p>On the technology side, HCI speaks both design and evaluation of technology.
The ultimate goal is to design technology that will work well with people. We
also evaluate how well that technology works to make sure we&rsquo;ve done it right.</p>

<h2 id="interaction:d554dde27ecc4b58f50be1ae68f8125f">Interaction:</h2>

<p>We need to make sure that people are not struggling or trying harder than
necessary to use the technology that we&rsquo;ve designed.</p>

<h2 id="users-tasks:d554dde27ecc4b58f50be1ae68f8125f">Users Tasks</h2>

<p>The users can be aynone from children to elderly adults and it can be people
working alone or working in teams, whether it&rsquo;s pairs or large groups.</p>

<p>The <strong>tasks</strong> are things that people are trying to accomplish with the system:</p>

<ul>
<li>Something easy, such as &ldquo;loggin in&rdquo;</li>
<li>Something hard, such as analyzing a large set of data</li>
</ul>

<p>Very important is also the environment of which people are trying to perform
this tasks. For example if we have a soldier trying to secure a system, it
makes a big difference if he&rsquo;s doing that in an office or if he&rsquo;s out working
in the warfield. So, the environment can dramatically effect the system we
build. Another term for the &ldquo;environment&rdquo; is &ldquo;context&rdquo;. You will hear people
refer to this as &ldquo;context of tasks&rdquo; or something like this.</p>

<p>As long as we understand the:</p>

<ol>
<li>user&rsquo;s tasks</li>
<li>and their context</li>
</ol>

<p>we later move on into the design. This is how we build technology which
considers everything we know about people and what they want to do. Hopefully,
we&rsquo;re going to build a system that makes it as easy as possible for people to
accomplish those tasks.</p>

<p>Last but certainly not least, there&rsquo;s an evaluation process. Note that this is
not evaluation of the system&rsquo;s security, but an evaluation that measures
(somehow) how easy the system is for the people to use it. If it&rsquo;s too
difficult for people, they&rsquo;ll simply find ways around it, making insecure
decisions by doing things off the manual. So, we want to make sure that the
system are easy enough so people will not try or think to bypass the security
for the sake of usability.</p>

<p>This is how HCI applies security. But let;s look at more detailed elements of
HCI:</p>

<h2 id="usability:d554dde27ecc4b58f50be1ae68f8125f">Usability</h2>

<p>Usability it&rsquo;s a way that we can measure and understand, how easy it is for
people to use a system.</p>

<h3 id="elements-of-usability-and-how-we-measure-them:d554dde27ecc4b58f50be1ae68f8125f">Elements of usability and how we measure them</h3>

<p>When we measuring usability, there are 5 main factors we need to consider:</p>

<ol>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Efficiency</li>
<li>Learnability</li>
<li>Memorability</li>
<li>User Preference</li>
</ol>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible to have some usability in one of this factors, but not all them.
Ocassionally, there&rsquo;s a trade-off, but what we want to do is to be able to look
at all of them, and make the system as usable as possible.</p>

<h4 id="speed:d554dde27ecc4b58f50be1ae68f8125f">Speed:</h4>

<p>Speed, is the way of measuring how quickly can a user accomplish the task. We
generally measure this by timing how long it takes them to complete it, and
ignore mistakes in this. So, we assume that the users are</p>
